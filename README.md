# E-Commerce Sales and Customer Behavior Analysis (SQL Project)

This project simulates an e-commerce environment using a MySQL relational database. It demonstrates end-to-end SQL capabilities, including schema design, data insertion, complex querying, and business intelligence reporting.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.
- Write optimized SQL queries to support strategic decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Language**: SQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench, CLI, or any MySQL-compatible interface

- `customers` – stores customer details including location and signup date
- `products` – stores product names, categories, and prices
- `orders` – stores customer purchases and total transaction values
- `order_items` – links products to orders and tracks quantities

## Key SQL Features Demonstrated

- Joins and Aggregations
- Subqueries and Filtering
- Date Functions and Grouping
- Window Functions (optional extensions)
- Business KPIs like CLV, AOV, Top Products
